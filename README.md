Source code of my CV.

To download latest version see [Releases page](https://github.com/Kraysent/CV/releases/latest).

To compile use 

```bash
make
```

which will produce both longer (`cv.pdf`) and shorter versions (`resume.pdf`).

To compile them separately use 

```bash
make short
make long
```
