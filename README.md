Source code of my CV.

To download PDFs use links: [resume (i.e. longer version)](https://github.com/Kraysent/CV/releases/latest/download/resume.pdf) and [CV (i.e. shorter version)](https://github.com/Kraysent/CV/releases/latest/download/cv.pdf).

To compile use 

```bash
make
```

which will produce both longer (`cv.pdf`) and shorter versions (`resume.pdf`).

To compile them separately use 

```bash
make short
make long
```
